      <h1>Blog about Mookerheide</h1>
      <p>The Netherlands are flat. At least, that's what everybody says, so it <i>must</i> be right, right?</p>
      <p>Well, guess again. In the area around Nijmegen, a city close to the German border, hills define the landscape. All the way from the village of Berg en Dal and the city of Groesbeek, to the more southern villages Mook and Cuijk: the area is great for hiking, cycling, running, or any other outdoor-based sport. Even if you practice watersports you can enjoy yourself: with the Maas and the Waal, two of the most important rivers of the Netherlands, there is room for rowing, swimming, even wakeboarding! Nijmegen is an ideal city for outdoor people. Not only does the city organize multiple running events each year (one of which is only for women), but it is home to the Nijmeegse Vierdaagse, internationally known as the Four Day Marches or the Walk of the World. All of these events take you along the many roads surrounded by woods and hills, but one special place to me is the Mookerheide.</p>
      <p>The Mookerheide is located near the village Mook (Mookerheide translates to <b>'heath of Mook'</b>) to the south-east of Nijmegen, and it is a great place for hiking along the color-coded routes or mountainbiking the special trails. Besides from the Mookerheide, Mook has a lot more to offer! A little bit further to the south-east, the village Plasmolen keeps guard of the Mookerplas (translation: lake of Mook), a great place for the watersports I mentioned earlier. It has a recreational beach and a small harbor for recreational boats: the Mookerplas is directly connected to the river Maas. The region also has a lot of war cemeteries and memorials, and.. Roman ruins! The Saint Jan Mountain (believe me, it's more a bigger hill) is a beautiful place to hike or run, with lots of vertical challenges <i>and</i> ruins for the history-lovers.</p>
      <p>So, we've established that you can keep yourself busy in this area. And we happen to live in this area. We spend a lot of spring and summer evenings hiking on the Mookerheide: heath surrounded by forrests. On the highest parts, you can see across the Maas, all the way to the cities on the other side of the river. The heath has many ups and downs, so even a small hike of about one hour gives you the feeling of a great exercise! You won't believe it, but there are actually places where you don't hear any cars -- and that's unique in the Netherlands. Also, gated parts of the heath are inhabited with oxen, but keep an eye out for other wildlife in the open area's: we once saw a deer in the middle of the path, in broad daylight!</p>
      <p>It was a very hot day, and we were hiking through the woods to stay out of the sun. The path we were on was only partially in the shadow, but in one of those spots of shadow we could see the silhouette of a deer. The deer stared at us, before walking away calmly. It was one of those moments where you wish you had a better camera with you. The rest of the hike was beautiful, but seeing that deer is what I remember the most of that day.</p>
      <p>To us, the nature surrounding Nijmegen is the biggest reason to stay there. Our backyard is a very unique sight in the Netherlands. </p>
